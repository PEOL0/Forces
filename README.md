# Forces

### Why?
I wanted to have a quicker way of adding differet forces in school.

### How?
I spent a couple of hours mostly one weekend to produce this code. And now you can use it too!
Simply click the "Run on Repl.it" badge or clone this repository and run the python code localy.
It works with as many forces you want as long as you have the size of the force and the angle relative to the x-axis. 

The script uses trigonometry to split the functions into the x- and y-composants then it sums up all of the x-xomposants and all of the y-composants withch allows it to use trigonometry again to determine the angle and the pythagoran thereum to get the size of the force.
